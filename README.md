## Scripts

### mountusb
A script I wrote because I was want to have a way to quickly mount all unmounted volumes (usually USB drives or SD cards)
without having to mess with any fstab stuff because of the temporary nature of flash drives.

Usage:
```
mountusb [options]
	-t   performs a test run, without mounting or writing anything to disk
```
